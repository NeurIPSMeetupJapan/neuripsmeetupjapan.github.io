### Abstract \| 概要

Reinforcement learning is the study of sequential optimal decision making, with the "simple" objective of maximising long-term reward. In this talk I will give my perspective on how the field has evolved to tackle ever more challenging problems. To finish, I will discuss the re-emerging perspective of reinforcement learning as supervised learning, which may provide a simplified approach to tackling many traditional reinforcement learning problems.
